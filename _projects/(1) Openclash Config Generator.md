# Openclash Config Generator

A tool used for tunneling equipment on the Openwrt operating system. This tool was developed with a web-based interface that functions as a link converter encode ``vmess-ws,`` ``trojan-ws,`` ``vless-ws`` and ``shadowsock-ss`` into .yaml format for Openclash config. Users are allowed to import, edit and save the config, and this tool is equipped with tools for monitoring whether the Openclash application is running or not, and other tools.
